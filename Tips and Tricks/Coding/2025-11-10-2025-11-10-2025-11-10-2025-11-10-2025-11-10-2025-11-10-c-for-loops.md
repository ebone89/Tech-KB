# 🔁 C Programming: `for` Loops
[[Loops]]

## 📌 Overview
A `for` loop is used for **definite iteration** — when the number of iterations is known ahead of time.

```c
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code block
}
```

## 🔍 Example: Print 1 to 5

```c
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

**Concepts:**
- `initialization`: sets the starting value
- `condition`: loop continues as long as this is true
- `update`: modifies the loop control variable each iteration

## ✅ Tips
- Avoid infinite loops: ensure condition becomes false eventually
- Use `break;` to exit early, `continue;` to skip to the next iteration
