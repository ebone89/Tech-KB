# 🔢 Integer Types in C

C provides various integer types for different sizes and value ranges.

## 📋 Comparison Table

| Type               | Signed/Unsigned | Typical Size | Example Range                        |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| `short`            | Signed           | 2 bytes      | -32,768 to 32,767                    |
| `unsigned short`   | Unsigned         | 2 bytes      | 0 to 65,535                          |
| `int`              | Signed           | 4 bytes      | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647      |
| `unsigned int`     | Unsigned         | 4 bytes      | 0 to 4,294,967,295                   |
| `long`             | Signed           | 4 or 8 bytes | Typically up to ±2 billion or more  |
| `unsigned long`    | Unsigned         | 4 or 8 bytes | 0 to 4+ billion or more              |
| `long long`        | Signed           | 8 bytes      | ±9 quintillion (±9×10^18)            |
| `unsigned long long`| Unsigned        | 8 bytes      | 0 to 18 quintillion (1.8×10^19)      |

## 🧪 Usage Examples

```c
short s = 32000;
unsigned int u = 4294967295U;
long l = 1000000000L;
long long big = 9223372036854775807LL;
```

- Add `U` for unsigned, `L` for long, `LL` for long long when using constants.

---

## ✅ When to Use

- Use `short` to save memory when values are small.
- Use `unsigned` if negative values are not needed (e.g., counting items).
- Use `long` or `long long` for very large numbers.

---

## ⚠️ Caution

- Overflowing a signed integer causes **undefined behavior**.
- Mixing signed and unsigned types can lead to **unexpected results**.

---
short s = 32767;                // max value for short
unsigned short us = 65535;     // max value for unsigned short

int i = -1000;                 // standard signed int
unsigned int ui = 100000;     // unsigned int, no negative values

long l = 1000000000L;         // long with L suffix
unsigned long ul = 4000000000UL; // unsigned long

long long ll = 9000000000000000000LL; // very large long long
unsigned long long ull = 18000000000000000000ULL; // unsigned long long

printf("%hd %hu %d %u %ld %lu %lld %llu\n", s, us, i, ui, l, ul, ll, ull);
