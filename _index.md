This knowledge base includes all folders under the root that do not start with a dot. These represent your inventory, standards, runbooks, and project documentation.

## Inventory

These YAML files describe the structured state of your network and services.

- [devices.yaml](inventory/devices.yaml)
- [vlan.yaml](inventory/vlan.yaml)
- [subnets.yaml](inventory/subnets.yaml)
- [services.yaml](inventory/services.yaml)

## Runbooks

Operational documents used to maintain, troubleshoot, and modify your environment.

- [Network Topology](runbooks/networking/topology.md)

## Standards

Reference documents that define how you operate the homelab.

- [Backup Standard](standards/backups.md)

## Projects

Project documentation goes here. This section will grow as you add build logs, design notes, sprint plans, or experiment notes.

(Empty for now)
